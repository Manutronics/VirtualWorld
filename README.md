This code was written by taken the Radu lessons. I am just practicing JS and found Radu's Youtube channel and found it very interesting. No, it's wonderful!
Along as this code was actualy written intead of cloned, the original code from his work is in https://github.com/gniziemazity/virtual-world.git.
In the description of Radus repo is the links to the two phases of this course.

Keep in mind that this code will either not be maintained nor extended without the knowledge of Radu.
